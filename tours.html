          <h2>Our Tours</h2>
          <p>Like lots of great ideas, Secret Scotland was born from a conversation over a drink in a cosy Scottish Inn.
            <br />
            <br />

            Explore the rich Scottish culture, beyond the traditions of tartan, whisky and bagpipes. Let us introduce
            you to the charms of Scotland.

        <h2 class="tour-title">Isle of Skye</h2>
        <p class="tour-text">
          The Isle of Skye, with the jagged Cuillin mountains at its heart, is surelyScotland's most romantic
          destination. Having inspired artists, musicians and travellers for hundreds of years. <br />
          <br />
          Travelling by mini coach, with a knowledgeable driver-guide, means we can show you Skye's highlights and it
          certainly never disappoints. <br />
          <br />
          You'll love the Trotternish peninsula. Here astonishing pinnacles, columns and cliffs adorn the landscape.
          You'll also see the iconic geological landslip of the Quiraing and Kilt Rock; a 90-metre tall basalt tower
          much like our national dress! The Old Man of Storr, a pinnacle of rock that adorns many a landscape picture,
          is just as magnificent in real life. <br />
          <br />

          You can enjoy a three or four day small group tour to Skye, the Highlands and Loch Ness from Glasgow and
          Edinburgh, giving you plenty of time to soak up the best of the island. If you have more time to spare why not
          book our six day island hopping tour to Mull, Iona, Skye, the Highlands and Loch Ness from both Glasgow and
          Edinburgh. All tours pop into Skye's main town of Portree, a quaint fishing village on a sheltered bay where
          you can enjoy local seafood, craft shops and a heritage centre. <br />

        <h2 class="tour-title">Isle of Iona</h2>
        <p class="tour-text">
          We reach the tiny, sacred Isle of Iona by a 10-minute ferry. Crossing over azure waters from the Isle of Mull.
          It's been a place of Christian worship and pilgrimage ever since St Columba and his companions came from
          Ireland. They established a monastery here in 563 AD. <br />
          <br />
          You can visit this special island with us on our four day small group tours to Mull, Iona and the Highlands
          and on our six day island hopping tours to Mull, Iona, Skye, the Highlands and Loch Ness. All of these tours
          leave from both Glasgow and Edinburgh. <br />
          <br />
          Visitor vehicles are not permitted on the Isle of Iona. You'll therefore travel on the ferry as a foot
          passenger. This only adds to its tranquillity. <br />
          <br />
          Visit Iona Abbey, still a place of worship, and take a stroll up the small hill above it, Torr an Aba, where
          St Columba's writing hut is thought to have stood. You can encounter St Oran's Chapel and Reilig Òdhrain. It's
          said to be the burial place of 48 ancient kings of Scotland, including Macbeth. <br />
          <br />
          It's worth rambling to the Iona\'s highest point at Dun I for panoramic views to other Hebridean islands such
          as Tiree, Coll and the Treshnish Islands. On a really clear day you'll glimpse Rhum, Eigg and Skye and even
          the Irish coast. <br />
          <br />
          As you arrive back on Mull from your Isle of Iona Tour you'll feel restored and at peace.<br />

        <h2 class="tour-title">Isle of Mull</h2>
        <p class="tour-text">
          Our Isle of Mull tour is full of outstanding natural beauty and wildlife. With miles of coastline and cliffs,
          majestic mountains, empty beaches and quaint villages. This is one of the best locations in Scotland to spot
          rare white-tailed sea eagles. Or even to glimpse whales, basking sharks and dolphins by boat. <br />
          <br />
          Our four day tours from Glasgow and Edinburgh transport you through the Highlands to Mull and the tiny sacred
          island of Iona, offering you plenty of time to appreciate this Hebridean island. You can also experience this
          special place on our six day island hopping tours to Mull, Iona, Skye, the Highlands and Loch Ness. These
          tours depart from both Glasgow and Edinburgh. <br />
          <br />
          You'll travel by luxury mini coach and then by ferry to Mull's main town Tobermory. Tobermory is famous for
          its brightly-painted buildings along the harbour front. We stay here for three nights on the four and six day
          tours where there's lots to enjoy such as its whisky distillery, live music, traditional pubs and pottery and
          craft shops. <br />
          <br />
          We'll take you to one of Scotland's most spectacular sandy beaches at Calgary. Before visiting the Kilmore
          standing stones above Dervaig. Nearby there's evidence of a Highland clearance village and ancient fort. A
          trip to Mull wouldn't be complete without landing on the unspoilt Isle of Ulva, a drop of paradise in the
          Hebridean waters with its white shell beaches and pristine blue waters. You might spot golden eagles, sea
          eagles and otters. While on Mull there's the option of a ferry trip to the geological wonder of Fingal's Cave
          on uninhabited Staffa.

        <h2 class="tour-title">Glencoe</h2>
        <p class="tour-text">
          Dramatic Glencoe will stir your emotions whatever the outdoor conditions. Scotland's most famous and arguably
          'darkest' glen sits in Lochaber Geopark. An outdoor playground of outstanding natural beauty and some of the
          best geology in the world.<br />
          <br />
          From the south, you cross bleak but beautiful Rannoch Moor, one of Europe's last remaining wildernesses. It
          then gives way to the steep-sided mountains on each side of Glencoe whose jagged ridges scar the sky. From
          Fort William in the north, two great sea lochs, Loch Linnhe and Loch Leven, lead into this tragic glen. <br />
          <br />
          Here in 1692 dozens of men, women and children from the Clan MacDonald were slaughtered in the darkness by the
          Campbells in one of Scotland's most shameful historic events. The Glencoe massacre still comes alive in songs
          and stories over 300 years later. When you're gazing in wonder at this vista it's not hard to imagine that
          bloody winter night. <br />
          <br />
          Glencoe has been featured in many films such as James Bond's Skyfall. It also appeared in Rob Roy and in the
          opening scenes of the very first episode of Outlander. Filming for the third Harry Potter film, Harry Potter
          and the Prisoner of Azkaban, took place here in May and June 2003. <br />
          <br />
          You can experience the special atmosphere of Glencoe on our one day tours to Loch Ness, Oban and Mallaig from
          Glasgow and on our Loch Ness tour from Edinburgh too. Glencoe also features on our three, four and six day
          small group tours from Glasgow and Edinburgh to the Western Highlands, Skye, Mull and Loch Ness. Your friendly
          driver-guide will point out iconic landmarks like the pyramid-shaped mountain Buachaille Etive Mòr and there
          are plenty of stops to photograph this spectacular Highland glen.

        <h2 class="tour-title">Loch-Lomond</h2>
        <p class="tour-text"> Scotland’s largest loch is your introduction to the spectacular Highlands on manyof our
          small group tours. This famous body of water is the beating heart of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National
          Park. 720 square miles of diverse scenery from lush rolling countryside and thick forest, to vast glens and
          craggy mountains. As we sojourn up the loch’s western shores you’ll have a fantastic view of Ben Lomond. It’s
          Scotland’s most southerly Munro (a mountain over 3000 feet high).<br />
          <br />

          The traditional village of Luss on the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond, is a stop on our many of our 1 day
          tours from Glasgow & Edinburgh, as well as our Shore Excursions from Greenock. Its cottages have been
          beautifully preserved from the 18th and 19th centuries. In the summer the villagers take great pride in their
          lavish floral displays. Luss has been a Christian settlement for at least 1500 years and its wonderfully
          restored church with its lychgate is well worth a visit. There’s even evidence of the Vikings having raided
          this area in 1263 in their stone ‘hogback’ grave in the atmospheric churchyard.<br />
          <br />

          For guests on our one day tours to Loch Ness, Haunting Glencoe and the Highlands, and to Glenfinnan Viaduct,
          Mallaig & Glencoe from Glasgow; there’s a stop further north for refreshments and photos on the side of Loch
          Lomond.<br />
          <br />

          For those looking for a more bespoke experience, we also offer private tours to Loch Lomond. With the
          opportunity to personalise your itinerary you can really explore what the loch has to offer. From kayaking to
          tree top adventures, there’s options for everyone including the thrill seekers out there.<br />
